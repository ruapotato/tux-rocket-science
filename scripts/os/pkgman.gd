# pkgman.gd — the package manager, with a window round it.
#
# `pkg` is the tool this game is really about: everything on the disk belongs
# to a package, and the database records the mode, a hash and the path of
# every file. This window does not reimplement one line of that. It runs
# `pkg list`, `pkg verify <name>`, `pkg diff <path>` and `pkg reinstall`, and
# it shows what they printed. If this window and the terminal ever disagree,
# one of them is lying, and it must not be this one.
#
# THAT MATTERS MOST HERE. A monitor that is wrong wastes your afternoon; a
# package manager that is wrong tells you a file matches when it does not, and
# you go and reinstall the wrong package. So the findings list is re-read from
# `pkg verify` every single refresh -- including after a reinstall, so what
# you see is the state of the disk AFTER the repair rather than an optimistic
# guess about what the repair did.
#
# VERIFY IS NOT A FAULT LIST. Every machine has configuration somebody edited
# on purpose, and those show as CHANGED because that is the truth. So the flow
# this window is built around is: pick a package, look at what differs, and
# `pkg diff` it BEFORE reinstalling anything -- a change that reads like an
# admin's decision ("# second one added after the outage in Feb") is not the
# same as one that reads like damage, and only a person can tell which.
#
# --force IS DRAWN AS THE DANGEROUS BUTTON BECAUSE IT IS ONE. Plain reinstall
# leaves edited config alone, which is what dpkg does and for the same reason.
# --force overwrites it and copies what was there to <file>.pkgsave, and that
# copy is the only undo in the game. So the button is amber, it is captioned
# with the consequence, and it takes two clicks -- the second one is the
# confirmation, and it disarms itself the moment anything else changes.
