# logview.gd — the log viewer, which is no longer the console in a second frame.
#
# A playtester's verdict on the old one: "it is the console window again, in a
# second window, with no filtering, no severity, no search. Either give it
# grep/level filtering or delete it." They were right -- it was literally a
# terminal.gd with the prompt taken out, showing the same text the console
# window beside it was already showing. A second copy of a thing is worth less
# than nothing, because you have to check whether it is the same copy.
#
# What a log viewer is FOR is finding the one line that matters in five hundred
# that do not. So this one does the three things the console cannot:
#
#   / filters      substring, live, case-insensitive, and the match is
#                  highlighted in the line. This is `grep` and it says so.
#   levels         w shows warnings and worse, e shows errors only, a shows
#                  everything, and the counts are in the header so you can see
#                  what you are hiding.
#   sources        s cycles console / previous boot off their disk / their
#                  /var/log/messages. The console window has exactly one.
#
# SEVERITY IS A GUESS AND THE WINDOW SAYS SO. NomnixOS does not stamp a level
# on a log line -- there is no `<3>` and no `err:` field, and this viewer will
# not invent one, because a line coloured red on no evidence sends you after a
# fault that is not there. What it does instead is match the words the system's
# own tools print when they fail, and the legend at the bottom names them, so a
# line's colour is a claim you can check. An unmatched line stays plain: not
# "INFO", just unclassified.
#
# It reads through machine.sh_on() like everything else here. It runs no
# command the player could not type, and it shows the command in the header.

# while it is up; while it is down the same files are readable off their disk
# at /mnt; and your own workstation is on the list on purpose -- it is a
# healthy install of the same system, so "what does this line look like on a
# machine that works" is one keypress away instead of a second window.

# Nothing is invented: every row is a command you could type, it is printed
# next to the label, and a source that comes back empty or refused is not
# offered. That is why the list changes under you -- attach the console and one
