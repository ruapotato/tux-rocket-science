# de.gd — the desktop, as a support engineer would find it.
#
# Modelled on the Hamnix desktop David pointed at: light panels top and
# bottom, a blue wallpaper, a column of launchers down the left, a window list
# in the top panel and a workspace switcher in the bottom one. Bright, not
# dark. Classic, not fashionable.
#
# THERE IS NO TICKET AND NO CUSTOMER.
#
# This desktop was a break-fix bench: a shift began with a phone call, a
# stranger read you an address off a sticker, you fixed their box and handed it
# back. David: "we don't have tickets, and we are not going to corrupt the
# computer OS anymore." What is left is the thing that was underneath all of it
# and is the reason the emulated OS exists at all -- THE SHIP HAS ONE COMPUTER,
# in the core, and every terminal aboard is a terminal onto that machine.
#
# So: the desktop comes up on the ship's computer, fitted and running. The
# service processor and `rcon` stay, because they are real programs and reaching
# a machine's console out of band is a real thing an engineer does. What went is
# the fiction wrapped round them -- the customer, their name, the chat window
# they spoke through, the complaint, and `done`.
#
# Nothing here diagnoses anything. Every command goes through one machine's
# own /bin/sh, and WHICH machine is a property of the window you typed it in.

# THE WALLPAPER IS A WALLPAPER, AND THE SHIP IS A WINDOW.

# David, first: "the background with all the icons should be removed. You can
# access those from the menu. And the default background should be a schematic
# of the ship." The icon field went then and is not coming back -- every
# application it held is in the Applications menu.
#
# And then, having played with the schematic behind everything: "instead of
# rendering the map to the desktop background directly, let's make it an app
# that's default open and running. Like an interior map app." So the plan of the
# deck moved into the ship map window, which opens with the desktop; the
# gradient is all that is left here.
#
# wall_deck() survives because it is the honest answer to "which deck is this
# desktop about", and the console, the map app and the transporter all want it.
# The flight scene, when the desktop is the ship's computer in flight: the
# Flight app reads it and flies through it. Optional: the desktop runs
# without one (the gates, a computer on the bench).

# David: "instead of rendering the map to the desktop background directly, let's

#
# He is right, and the reason is not cosmetic. A wallpaper cannot be moved,
# resized, closed, or have a second one open beside it; it cannot be raised over
# the window you are reading; and every window you open hides part of it. Worse,
# it was a SECOND drawing of the deck the player is on, sitting behind a window
# that draws the same thing -- and the wallpaper's copy could not be interacted
# with at all, so clicking the compartment you were looking at did nothing. The
# ship map app is the drawing now, it opens with the desktop, and the wallpaper
# is a wallpaper.
#
# wall_paints/wall_drawn/wall_title went with it. What they were for -- a gate
# checking the picture without photographing it -- is served by the map app's
# own `draws`, `_drawn` and `title_drawn`, which are the same three facts about

# though nothing was tiling them, which David spotted immediately. Tiling only
# ever happens because you dragged a window to an edge.
#
# THE CASCADE STOPPED CASCADING AFTER THREE WINDOWS. The step was fixed at
# seven positions and each one was then CLAMPED to fit the screen, so as soon
# as a window was tall enough that step four hung off the bottom -- which at
# 1280x800 is anything over about 540px, ie. most of them -- every subsequent
# window was clamped to the SAME y. A playtester had five windows in one pile.
# Two things were wrong: the run has to end where the room ends rather than at
# a hardcoded seven, and when it ends the next window starts a new run instead
# of landing on top of the last one. Windows bigger than the desktop are cut
# down to it first, because a window you cannot reach the bottom of is worse
