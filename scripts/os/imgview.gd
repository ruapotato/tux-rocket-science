# imgview.gd — the image viewer, for a machine that has no images.
#
# THIS IS NOT A PHOTOGRAPH VIEWER PRETENDING. There is no image decoder in
# this OS, there are no image files on the disk, and `/home/nomowner/Pictures`
# contains one file, a README, whose first line is "There are no pictures on
# this machine and there never were." An app that drew a sunset over that
# would be the only thing in NOMINAL that lies to the player.
#
# So it views what IS picture-shaped here: text. ASCII art, `cowsay` output
# saved to a file, a .plan, a banner in a README. That is a real category of
# thing on this disk and it wants exactly what an image viewer gives you --
# fit to window, one-to-one, zoom, pan, and arrow keys to walk the directory.
#
# Everything on screen is one command: `cat <path>` for the content, `ls -l`
# on the containing directory for the entry list and the sizes. When cat
# refuses -- "cannot read" for a directory, "binary file, 7776 bytes" for an
# ELF image -- that line is shown VERBATIM and nothing is drawn. Refusing to
# render is information: it tells you what the file actually is.
#
# The zoom is a canvas transform, not a font size. Scaling the font size
# quantises to whole pixels, so "fit" lands on the wrong scale and the last
# column of a piece of art falls off the edge -- which for ASCII art means the
# right-hand side of every face is missing.
