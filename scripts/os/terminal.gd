#
# David: "The terminal especially is a piece of junk. I don't want a history
# scroll back and a stagnant input line. I want it to resemble a real
# terminal. When you type, it goes into the actual terminal space."
#
# So there is no LineEdit anywhere. This control owns the screen: the
# transcript and the line being typed are the same buffer, drawn by the same
# code, with one block cursor sitting where the next character will land. Keys
# arrive through _gui_input and are handled here -- printable characters,
# backspace, left and right, home and end, and a command history on the up and
# down arrows, which is the thing you miss within about ten seconds of not
# having it.
#
# The control never interprets a command. It hands the line to on_command and
# prints whatever comes back, so this file cannot know anything the machine
# does not. Tab completion obeys the same rule: the FIRST word is completed
# against the list of programs the guest is built with, and every later word
# is completed by asking the machine to `ls` the directory in question. No
# guessed filenames, ever -- a terminal that offers you a path the machine
# does not have is lying to you about the machine.
